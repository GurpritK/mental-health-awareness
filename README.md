#### Coding using AI
I leveraged AI throughout my development process to both implement new features and refine existing code. For instance, I would often use a core piece of code from a framework like Bootstrap and then apply AI to enhance its aesthetics or add new functionality.

A specific example of this was when I needed a horizontal slidebar to display a gallery of tips. After several unsuccessful attempts at coding it myself using resources from Bootstrap and YouTube, I turned to AI. I described my issue and asked it to convert my existing carousel slideshow into a scrollable horizontal slidebar, which it implemented perfectly without any issues.

Beyond major features, I also used AI for more routine tasks to increase efficiency. This included setting repeat attributes on HTML elements and consolidating CSS to remove duplicate code. I also used AI to perform a final cleanup of the project, which involved removing redundant code and combining repeated selectors in the CSS. By augmenting my workflow with AI, I saved a significant amount of time, giving me the freedom to experiment with different features and designs.

Finally, AI was an invaluable partner during the testing phase. I used Chrome Developer tools to pinpoint issues with the website's layout or features, and then I would simply direct the AI to the line of code that needed fixing. This allowed me to see the effects of the changes immediately and revert them if they weren't what I wanted, making the debugging process much faster and more intuitive.
